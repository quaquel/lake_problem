## Lake model demo
This repository contains a demo of the functionality of the exploratory
modeling workbench. This demo has been used for a presentation at
iEMSs 2016, and has more recently been updated to reflect the latest
version of the ema_workbench. An in depth discussion of the workbench can 
be found in Kwakkel (2017) The Exploratory Modeling Workbench: An open 
source toolkit for exploratory modeling, scenario discovery, and 
(multi-objective) robust decision making. doi: 10.1016/j.envsoft.2017.06.054

The main content of the demo is in the jupyter notebook. lake_model.py and
moro.py contain standalone aspects of the integrated demo. lake_model.py 
contains the code for exploration, while moro contains a robust multi-objective
optimization example.
