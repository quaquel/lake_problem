## Lake model demo
This repository contains a demo of the functionality of the exploratory
modeling workbench. This demo has been used for a presentation at
iEMSs 2016, and has more recently been updated to reflect the latest
version of the ema_workbench. 

The main content of the demo is in the jupyter notebook. lake_model.py and
moro.py contain standalone aspects of the integrated demo. lake_model.py 
contains the code for exploration, while moro contains a robust multi-objective
optimization example. 

The moro example requires borg (see http://borgmoea.org). I am using an
alternative python wrapper for borg, this wrapper is not included in the 
repository, but available upon request.
